This is exactly what it looks like. Any commits should be in MD format (this is code, do not delete this repo).
Naming convention is `recipe-name.md` - the simpler the better.
Content is formated as such:
```
# Recipe Name:
Ingredient, list, here
1. Instruction 1
2. Instruction 2
3. Instruction 3
[...]
```
